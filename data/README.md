# Mock Datasets

The data here includes
- Points of dimensions 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 where components are uniformly distributed on [0, 1]; 
these files are ones named `uniform/d{dimension}_s{size}_{sample_no}`.
- Points of dimensions 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 which are clustered into groups; 
these files are ones named `clustered/d{dimension}_s{size}_{sample_no}`.
- Points that marks cities of the world and of Thailand; 
these files are `cities/cities` and `cities/cities-th` respectively.

The cities data was taken from `simplemaps.com/data/world-cities`.
